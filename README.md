# ECE 391 Flake

A Nix flake for UIUC's ECE 391 (Computer Systems Engineering) class.

Heavily inspired by [riscv-qemu-toolchain](https://github.com/RoshanAH/riscv-qemu-toolchain), with some notable deviations:
- Software versions are matched with course-provided tooling
- `clangd` works, and properly uses the custom RISC-V stdlib
